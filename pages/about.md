# It's time Tekla did the work.

Starting to write code can be a daunting experience. To the uninitiated, you are literally learning a new language. However, when seeing what people have created to enhance the Tekla Structures experience, it can inspire others to do the same.

Using the Tekla Open API and a coding language like C#, it is possible to interact with model and drawing objects in Tekla Structures, improving quality and increasing productivity at any stage of a project.

Working with Tekla Structures for the past 18 years, coupled with 15 years experience of using the Tekla Open API and a past winner of Tekla's annual Open API Competition, I would like to offer my knowledge to the wider Tekla Structures community.

So don't be shy - contact me on your preferred platform to see what is possible today.
