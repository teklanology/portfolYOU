I started this blog many years ago; while my intentions were good, my interest waned. That was until recently when a former collegue reached out, asking if I was interested in helping him understand the Tekla Open API to automate a manual process in Tekla Structures. Little did I realise the fuse was now lit. 

Immediately after the first session, it occurred to me that he isn't alone and there are others out there with the same ambition but lacked support. That night, I began plotting my return by resurrecting this blog.

With a rekindled interest in helping others, and an updated [about](../about) page, I like to think that I'm back!
