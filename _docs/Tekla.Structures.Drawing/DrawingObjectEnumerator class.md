In this guide we explain how to iterate through model and drawing objects in the current model or drawing.

For models, use the class ModelObjectEnumerator and for drawings, DrawingObjectEnumerator.

## Enumerate drawing objects
The DrawingObjectEnumerator class provides the means to iterate through drawing object instances. Drawing object enumerators are generated by the container view and they contain drawing objects that are children of the container view instance.

This example shows how to enumerate all selected objects in the current drawing and delete them.

```csharp
Drawing CurrentDrawing = CurrentDrawingHandler.GetActiveDrawing();

DrawingObjectEnumerator AllObjects = CurrentDrawing.GetSheet().GetAllObjects();

while (AllObjects.MoveNext())
{
    if (AllObjects.Current is Line)
    {
        AllObjects.Current.Delete();
    }
}
```
