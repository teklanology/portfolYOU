When I first set out to create the original incarnation of this blog the API landscape was very different. There was only a few other developers out there creating code, the majority if not all of that code was locked away on Tekla's private discussion forums and their online help was only available to those who paid maintenance. Flash forward to now and there is a flurry of other developers, hosting code on various sites and personal blogs and Tekla's stance is much more open with API reference, tutorials and example code available to the general public.
